<p> 
Our paper "Mahalanobis Distance-based Multi-view Optimal Transport for Multi-view Crowd Localization" was accepted to ECCV 2024!
</p>

This is the second top conference paper that I cooperated with my students.
Congratulations to Kaiyi!

The paper was rejected by CVPR 2024, then resubmitted and accepted to ECCV 2024.

Papers and codes are on the way.
