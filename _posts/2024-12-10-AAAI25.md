Our paper "View Transformation Robustness for Multi-View 3D Object Reconstruction with Reconstruction Error-Guided View Selection" was accepted to AAAI 2025!

This is the third top conference paper that I cooperated with my students. Congratulations to Zhouhang and Tao!

The paper was rejected by ACM MM 2024, then resubmitted and accepted to AAAI 2025.
