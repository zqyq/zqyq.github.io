Congratulations to Yunfei, Kaiyi, and Jisuan for being awarded the Graduate Student Independent Training Project at Shenzhen University, with a total funding of 50,000 RMB. 

This is a highly competitive program, with only four projects approved across the entire college. 

Under my supervision, they work together and explore multi-object tracking tasks in complex scenarios.
