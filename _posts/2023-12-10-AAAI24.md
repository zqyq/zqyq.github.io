title: "One Paper Was Accepted to AAAI 2024!"

<p> 
Our paper "Multi-view People Detection in Large Scenes via View-wise Contribution Weighting" was accepted to AAAI 2024!
</p>

This is the first paper that I cooperated with my students Mr. Yunfei Gong and Mr. Daijie Chen. Congratulations to us!
The paper was first rejected by ICCV 2023, and then resubmitted and accepted to AAAI 2024.

This is a good start for me and my group iMUSE because it's our first top conference paper.
We believe the second one is on the way...
