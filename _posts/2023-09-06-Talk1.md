<p> 
I gave a talk to the students of the Tencent Cloud AI class of CSSE, SZU about deep learning-based counting methods.

The Tencent Cloud AI class of CSSE is a high-standard undergraduate class built jointly by Tencent and SZU. Students in this class have the highest National College Entrance Examination scores in SZU (>620 in Guangdong Province).

We will work together on AI-driven agriculture in the future!
